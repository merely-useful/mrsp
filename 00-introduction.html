### Managing Research Software Projects
# Introduction

---

# What is a research software project?

- Software is created and run to answer a question
- Papers, theses, and other reports are the product
- The software is "just" a tool
- Shades into projects that produce software for other researchers to use

---

# Who are you?

- Degree(s) in some research domain
- Little or no formal training in software development
  - Which is OK: many professional programmers don't have computer science degrees
- In a team of 1â€“12 people
- Timelines of weeks or months

---

# Where we've been, where we're going

| Then | Now  | Next |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Dropbox | Git repository | Branching workflow |
| "Just do it" | Slack / mailing list | Martha's Rules |
| Interactive analysis | A big pile of scripts | Build tools / CI |
| Word / Google Docs | Notebooks | Site builder |
| "It doesn't crash" | "Are there any NAs?" | Assertions / unit tests |
| "Um, hi?" | README + LICENSE | CONTRIBUTING + CoC |

# How we're going to get there

- The best ideas in the world won't matter if you can't implement them
- The best tools in the world won't save your project if you're arguing with each other all the time

1. Who uses your software?
1. How do they find it?
1. Who decides what will happen next?
