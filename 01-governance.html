# What problems are we trying to solve?

- Opaque decision making
  - "Apparently we have rules…"
- The tyranny of structurelessness
  - "It's not what you know, it's who you know."
- A low lottery factor
  - "They left and now no one knows how to do this."
- Low productivity
  - "Oh no: not another meeting…"

# Martha's Rules

## Putting forward a proposal

- Anyone can put forward a proposal by filing it at least 24 hours before a scheduled meeting
  - One-line summary
  - Background information
  - Concrete proposal
  - Pros and cons
  - Alternatives
- At most two pages (preferably shorter)

---

# Martha's Rules

## Establishing a quorum

- A quorum is established if half or more of voting members are present
- …which means there must be:
  - A written rule about how to become a member
  - A written rule about when and how someone stops being a member
- The meeting may not discuss or vote on a proposal unless its sponsor (or their delegate) is present.

---

# Martha's Rules

## Sense vote

- The sponsor has 5 minutes to present the proposal
- Members cast a *sense vote*: support, neutral, or oppose
  - If everyone supports or is neutral, pass immediately
  - If a majority is opposed or neutral, send proposal back to sponsor for further work

---

# Martha's Rules

## Discussion and final vote
- If a minority of members oppose, set a timer for 10 minutes of moderated discussion
- Then call a final binary vote
  - Everyone must support or oppose (no neutral votes allowed)
- If a majority support, the proposal is accepted
- Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work

---

# Roles and responsibilities

- Gives you a list of what actually needs to be done
  - It's always longer than you first expect
- Tells everyone who to go to for what
  - Particularly when their first choice is on holiday
- Helps with succession planning
  - "We don't have anyone who does that any more…"

# How to run a meeting

## Before

- Decide if there actually needs to be one
  - If the only purpose is to share information, the answer is "no"
- Write and circulate an agenda with timings
  - "Our open issues on GitHub" is not an agenda
- Put the most important or contentious things first
  - 20 minutes on coffee club and 5 minutes on budget is probably not the right balance

---

# How to run a meeting

## During

- Pick a moderator
  - They always pick the next person to speak
  - When they want to make point, be clear that they're speaking as themselves as not as the moderator
- Require politeness
  - No interruptions, no rudeness, no rambling
- Devices down
  - Unless required for accessibility

---

# How to run a meeting

## During

- Take notes
  - Of the meeting as a whole
  - While others speak so that you can ask good questions
- Keep a backlog
  - Stops conversation going off track
  - Helps with time management

---

# How to run a meeting

## After

- Circulate the minutes
  - Email + a wiki page or a file in version control
- Be clear where discussion should go
  - File or update action items
  - GitHub issue tracker is a good place
