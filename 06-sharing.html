# What problems are we trying to solve?

- Re-use
  - "Paywalls are the raised middle fingers of academia"
- Credit
  - "A hundred thousand users doesn't get you tenure"
- Privacy
  - "What can be mis-used, will be mis-used"

# Scope

- Discussion of publication applies mainly to academics
- Commercial reports are often confidential

---

# Software licensing

- Standard file #4 is `LICENSE(.md)`
  - Who can do what with the project's software
- Use a permissive license for software
  - The GPL's virality has proven to be unnecessary
- MIT License: anyone can do anything, you are not liable, they have to give you credit
- Hippocratic License: all of the above plus do no harm
- *Do not write your own license*

---

# Everything else

- Use Creative Commons (CC) for data and publications
- CC-0: anyone can use it any way they like
  - Best for raw data
- CC-BY: must cite you as source
  - Make sure `CITATION` is up to date
- CC-BY-NC: need your permission to use commercially
  - Makes institutions happy
- *Do not write your own license*

- Check manifests against actual datasets
  - A script that checks Markdown headings against filenames is a useful addition to your CI
- Decide which results need to be in version control and which can be regenerated
- Add `.gitignore` to `results` directory to ignore certain files

---

# Publishing

- Put open access versions on the web
  - Preprint servers like arxiv.org
  - Your own website
- Give every report a DOI
  - Zenodo does this for free
- Give datasets and software releases DOIs as well
  - GitHub-Zenodo integration makes this easy

---

# Make yourself citable

- People change names, institutions, email addresses, genders, titlesâ€¦
- Get an ORCID and include it in all publications

---

<h1 class="project-lead">As project lead</h1>

- Get DOIs for all publications, datasets, and packages
  Make sure they're included in `CITATION`
- Ask all new contributors for ORCIDs
- Submit reports to preprint servers
  - Better yet, publish in open access journals

---

# Privacy and security

- Privacy: don't collect information
- Security: safeguard what you do collect
- Laws are complex, inconsistent, and constantly changing
- *Ask an expert*
  - And get the answer in writing
- *Always ask those affected for permission*
  - "Nothing for us, without us"

<h1 class="exercise">How are you and your work identified?</h1>

1. Search for your reports online: how accurate and complete are the results?
1. Do it again in an anonymous browser tab: how much is now inaccessible?
1. Search for yourself online: how accurate and complete are the results?

---

<h1 class="exercise">Check your own citations</h1>

1. Are your datasets and packages citable?
1. Do your own publications cite them?
1. Are your contributors citable and cited?
