### Managing Research Software Projects
# Conclusion

# The path ahead

| Then | Now  | Next |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Dropbox | Git repository | Branching workflow |
| "Just do it" | Slack / mailing list | Martha's Rules |
| Interactive analysis | A big pile of scripts | Build tools / CI |
| Word / Google Docs | Notebooks | Site builder |
| "It doesn't crash" | "Are there any NAs?" | Assertions / unit tests |
| "Um, hi?" | README + LICENSE | CONTRIBUTING + CoC |

# How to start

- Remember that:
  - No one does all of this
  - Everyone does what they do in their own way
- Pick one—and only one
  - Do that for a quarter, then pick another
- Remember that we're here to help
  - And to sympathize

<h1 class="exercise">What keeps you going?</h1>

- Why do you care about all of this?
- What will you in five years be grateful that you today did?
