# What is a research software project?

- Software is created and run to answer a question
- Papers, theses, and other reports are the product
- The software is "just" a tool
- Shades into projects that produce software for other researchers to use

---

# Who are you?

- Degree(s) in some research domain
- Little or no formal training in software development
  - Which is OK: many professional programmers don't have computer science degrees
- In a team of 1â€“12 people
- Timelines of weeks or months

# Where we've been, where we're going

| Then | Now  | Next |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| Mail attachment | Git repository | Branching workflow |
| "Just do it" | Slack / mailing list | Martha's Rules |
| Interactive analysis | A big pile of scripts | Build tools / CI |
| Word/Google Docs | Notebooks | Site builder |
| "It doesn't crash" | "Are there any NAs?" | Assertions/unit tests |
| "Um, hi?" | README + LICENSE | CONTRIBUTING + CoC |

# How we're going to get there

- The best ideas in the world won't matter if you can't implement them
- The best tools in the world won't save your project if you're arguing with each other all the time
