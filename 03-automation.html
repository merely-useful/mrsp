### Managing Research Software Projects
# Automation

---

# What problems are we trying to solve?

- Reproducibility
  - "How did I produce Figure 3?"
- Transferability
  - "How did they produce Figure 3?"
- Efficiency
  - "…and then you type this, and then you type that…"

---

# Make and its children

- Make was created in 1975 by a summer intern to recompile C programs
  - "If these files are out of date, re-create them"
- Dozens of imitators, but none have achieved critical mass
  - Use drake for R
  - Use snakemake for Python

---

# Dependencies

- A depends on B
- B depends on C
- So if C changes:
  - Re-create B
  - Then re-create A
- Don't re-create D unless E changes

---

# Rules

- A depends on all B's
- Each B<sub>i</sub> depends on a C<sub>i</sub>
- So if some C<sub>i</sub> change:
  - Re-create those B<sub>i</sub>
  - Then re-create A
- Write one rule for C<sub>i</sub> → B<sub>i</sub>
  - Just like you would write a function

# Automation and notebooks

- Notebooks designed for interactive operation
  - Linear sequence of steps, short execution times
- Build managers designed for batch operation
  - Complex interactions, possibly long execution times
- Use notebooks as steps in a build
- Don't yet have good tools to express complex dependencies in notebooks

---

<h1 class="project-lead">As project lead</h1>

- Make sure all repeated actions are in the build file
- Make sure they are documented in the build file
  - Because otherwise the docs will fall out of date
- Teach newcomers how to use the build system
  - Probably new to most of them
- Decide what should be in notebooks vs. packages

---

# Continuous integration

1. Contributor pushes to repository
1. GitHub notices a CI configuration file
1. Creates a fresh virtual machine
1. Clones a fresh copy of repository
1. Runs tests, creates website, etc.
1. Reports results
1. …all while you're making tea

---

# Because

- Never forgets to do it
- Never forgets to tell people what it did
- Never forgets what it did
- Can do things on operating systems or software versions that individual developers don't have
- Documents the workflow
  - A checklist that is constantly checked

---

<h1 class="project-lead">As project lead</h1>

- Same advice as the build system
- Manage infrastructure
- Teach people how to use it
- Make sure they do
- Recalibrate your productivty measures

---

<h1 class="exercise">What do you do now?</h1>

1. What tasks do you repeat most often on your project?
1. What does a newcomer have to set up in order to do these things?
1. Where is this documented?

---

<h1 class="exercise">What alternatives should you consider?</h1>

1. What is the biggest difference between GitHub Actions and a service like Travis-CI?
1. Which would be a better choice for your project? Why?
