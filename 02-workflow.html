### Managing Research Software Projects
# Workflow

---

# What problems are we trying to solve?

- Missing or duplicated work
  - "I'm sure I did that… or did you?"
- No one knows what's happening next
  - "I think we're going to do that…?"
- Complicated merges
  - This is not a happy project

---

# Use issues as a shared to-do list

- "Version control tells you where you've been; issues tell you where you're going."
- An issue's one-line title is its most important feature
- Its tags are almost as important
  - Kind: `bug`, `feature`, `discussion`, `action`
  - State: `current`, `in-progress`, `ready-to-review`
  - Reason: `finished`, `wont-fix`, `duplicate`
- Don't use for releases: quickly becomes overwhelming

<h1 class="project-lead">As project lead</h1>

- Triage bugs weekly
  - What should be closed?
  - What should be assigned?
- Maintain the list of tags and their meanings
- Recalibrate your productivity metrics
  - This is now your job

---

# Create a pull request for every change

- Gives people a way to give feedback
- "Always" is simpler to enforce than "usually"
- Remember that a PR is a marker
  - Always shows difference between source and destination branches
  - So source can be updated repeatedly based on reviews—a new PR is not required

---

# To fork or not to fork?

- Branches in one repo: easier to contribute to other people's work in progress
- Branches in forked (per-contributor) repos: less chance of someone accidentally updating master
- Main repository should belong to organization, not to an individual
  - Because people move on

---

# A feature-branch workflow

- `main` holds the most recent working version
- Create a branch from `main` for each feature or bug fix
- Give branches meaningful names (just like variables)
- When the feature is done:
  - Merge `main` → `feature-branch`
  - Make sure everything still runs
  - Create a PR `feature-branch` → `main`

---

# Managing releases

- Create a branch from `main` when a report is published or the package is released
- When fixes are needed:
  - Create a feature branch from `main`
  - Merge `feature` → `main` → `release`
- Keeps the workflow consistent
- Ensures that changes aren't misplaced
- You may need to rename the release branch

---

# Creating branches from branches

- Try to avoid, but if you do…
- Complete `first`
- Build second on top of it
- Merge `first` before second
- Then merge into second and merge back
- Graph of Git history should never have crossed lines

<h1 class="project-lead">As project lead</h1>

- Assign PRs to people for review
- Remind people to claim issues and mark as in-progress when they create branches
- Do reviews yourself
- Handle merges to `main`
- Prune old branches and stale PRs

---

<h1 class="exercise">Who can do what?</h1>

1. Who can decide that an issue won't be addressed?
1. Who can decide that a fix isn't ready to be merged?
1. How are these decisions communicated?

---

<h1 class="exercise">How clean is your project's history?</h1>

Run this command:

`git log --graph --abbrev-commit --decorate --all`

1. How well can you understand your project's history?
1. Look at someone else's history: how well can you understand it?
